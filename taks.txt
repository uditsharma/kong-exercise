- create event source which can read from a file
- create producer app which can read from this event source and publish to a topic
- create consumer app which can read from this topic and publish the records to open search
- lets use kafka stream provider abstraction  to create a pipeline where we can apply transformation on the records before publishing to open search
- make it runnable via gradle as separate tasks
- gradle tasks to query the open search and print the records
- if needed we can use  docker to run these producer and consumer apps
